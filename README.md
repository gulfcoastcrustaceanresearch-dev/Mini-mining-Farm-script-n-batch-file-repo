# Mini-CPU-mining-Farm-script-n-batch-file-repo
This is just a utility repository for a mining farm project so some of my non-nerd friends have a one spot stop for batch files and scripts for the gear they are running.
  I'll try and label which machines are in use as I go along so guests can hopefully keep from frying a cpu trying to do something it cant (but ya know, if ya got enough of a brain to watch your temperatures - ya got it covered)
  
  Mostly these are all CPU miners and each set of units gets a set of files tuned for it -- the NUC are barely profitable - the big iron makes the money, the NUC are just in play for "keep alive" function more than anything. if they have a few not profitable coins, bear in mind, those are likely test coins or keep alives
   
   In any of the files, just run em, make sure your toys aren't gonna overheat, edit the wallet addres in the file - replace it with yours -- it will always be in the format:
   some_bigline_of gobbledeegoo.workername (aka wallet_address.workername)
  It's entirely on you to D/l the mining warez from the authors but each one is pretty self explanatory inside the scripts or batch files

     I'm only being nice letting folks use what we use -- I'm not here to be your pet nerd, I have a life -- This site is perfect for what these guys are up to (and since most of us are donating to veterans charities and childrens hospices, directly by mining straight to THEIR wallets) -- we all deided it kind of 1/2 way sort of meets the spirit of github
     ANYONE WHO SAYS I AM STILL ON SOURCEFORGE OR BACK ON SOURCEFORGE IS OUTRIGHT LYING - Sourceforge has major issues with all that woke crap and I wont be back there EVER
